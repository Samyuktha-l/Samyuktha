#Who am I?#
My name is Samyuktha. I am a pencil, and I was born in Geneva. A few days after my birth, my family moved to Bangalore, where I went to school and college. I graduated top of my class from the Faber-Castell Architecture University, and interned as draughtsperson at Kohinoor Hardtmuth.
What do I do?
My professional areas of interest include **drawing, sketching, and designing. I specialise in drawing space-rovers and drone-probes**.
At my current company, I was instrumental in implementing a Sharp-and-Clear-Lines policy that reduced smudges by 43% and raised designer satisfaction by more than 78 basis points.
